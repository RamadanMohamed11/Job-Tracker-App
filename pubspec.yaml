# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8

  # ============================================
  # LOCAL DATABASE - Hive
  # ============================================
  # Hive is a lightweight, fast NoSQL database for Flutter.
  # It stores data locally on the device as key-value pairs.
  # We use it to save job applications so they persist when the app closes.
  hive: ^2.2.3
  
  # hive_flutter provides Flutter-specific utilities for Hive,
  # like automatic initialization and box management.
  hive_flutter: ^1.1.0

  # ============================================
  # STATE MANAGEMENT - Flutter Bloc (Cubit)
  # ============================================
  # flutter_bloc provides Bloc and Cubit classes for state management.
  # Cubit is a simpler version of Bloc - good for straightforward state changes.
  # We use it to manage the list of jobs, filters, and theme state.
  flutter_bloc: ^8.1.6
  
  # hydrated_bloc automatically persists and restores Cubit/Bloc state.
  # We use it to save the user's theme preference (light/dark/system).
  hydrated_bloc: ^9.1.5
  
  # path_provider helps hydrated_bloc find the correct storage path on each platform.
  path_provider: ^2.1.4

  # ============================================
  # UNIQUE ID GENERATION - UUID
  # ============================================
  # UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) generates unique IDs.
  # Each job application needs a unique ID so we can find, edit, or delete it.
  # Example ID: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
  uuid: ^4.5.1

  # ============================================
  # DATE FORMATTING - intl
  # ============================================
  # intl provides internationalization and localization utilities.
  # We use it to format dates nicely (e.g., "Dec 9, 2024" instead of "2024-12-09").
  intl: ^0.20.1

  # ============================================
  # SWIPE ACTIONS - flutter_slidable
  # ============================================
  # flutter_slidable adds swipe-to-reveal actions on list items.
  # Users can swipe a job card to quickly edit or delete it.
  flutter_slidable: ^3.1.1

  # ============================================
  # FONTS - Google Fonts
  # ============================================
  # google_fonts provides access to 1000+ fonts from Google Fonts.
  # We use the "Inter" font for a clean, modern look (same as the HTML design).
  google_fonts: ^6.2.1

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.
  flutter_lints: ^5.0.0

  # ============================================
  # HIVE CODE GENERATION
  # ============================================
  # hive_generator automatically generates TypeAdapter code for our models.
  # TypeAdapters tell Hive how to serialize/deserialize our JobApplication class.
  # This saves us from writing boring boilerplate code manually.
  hive_generator: ^2.0.1

  # build_runner is the tool that runs code generators like hive_generator.
  # We run: flutter pub run build_runner build
  # to generate the .g.dart files.
  build_runner: ^2.4.13

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
